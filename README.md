# Another File Manager

A dead-simple PHP file manager for personal use.  
I know there are dozens of these out there—but this one is mine. I built it to be small, fast, and easy to drop onto my own private server.

## 💡 Features

- Single-file PHP script
- Minimal UI, focused on functionality
- Upload, view, and delete files from a web interface
- Simple to deploy—just drop it on your server

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Drop `index.php` into a directory on your private server.
2. Open it in a web browser.
3. Done.

You must have PHP installed and running on the server.

## 🔒 Security Note

This script **does not** include authentication, input sanitization, or other protections. It **should only be run in trusted environments** (e.g., a local or intranet server). Exposing it to the internet is a security risk.

## 🛠️ Future Plans

I use this script personally and will patch things as I run into bugs.  
You’re welcome to fork, customize, or improve it however you like.
